|<sub><sup>**Fig. 1. Study and tasks design.** A) Schematic of the study visits (boxes). Items administered at each visit are listed in chronological order from top to bottom, e.g. the self-reference task was administered at the end of all MRI sessions. B) Schematic of the NFB runs. Participants were instructed to focus on sentences pre-recorded in their own voice (focus blocks) and to ignore unfamiliar voices (ignore blocks) pre-recorded by a stranger. After each task block, participants indicated how they reckoned they had performed at the NFB (“?” blocks). Visual NFB representing activity levels from the individualized STG (experimental group only) or MC (control group only) was presented after the task blocks in the form of a thermometer. C) Self-reference task schematic. Participants listened to a series of trait adjectives pre-recorded by a gender-matched stranger. Participants were instructed to judge whether the adjectives could be used to describe themselves (self blocks), President Abraham Lincoln (other blocks), or were positive traits (semantic blocks). Before each block, a visual cue (e.g., the word “positive”) reminded the participant which block was about to begin. AHs, auditory verbal hallucinations; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; MC, motor cortex; NFB, neurofeedback; sec, seconds; STG, superior temporal gyrus; T1w, T1 weighted structural MRI image.</sup></sub>|<sub><sup>**Fig. 2. Group and individual self-referential activation results.** Results of self-referential processing activity (self>semantic) within and between the experimental (n = 11; blue) and control group (n = 11; yellow). A) Between-group differences showing activity increase within the self-reference network after NFB (post>pre-NFB) greater for the experimental group compared to the control group (experimental>control). Colored circles indicate the same clusters across multiple slices, covering portions of the ACC (blue), superior frontal gyrus (green), and mPFC (blue and yellow) in both horizontal (left) and sagittal (right) brain views. All clusters were derived using pTFCE and thresholded at a voxel z-value>3.1, corresponding to a significance p-value<0.001. B) Task activity levels average across the identified clusters (y-axis) for the baseline fMRI visit (pre) and the NFB visit (post) for each group. C) Individual activity change levels (filled bars) for each participant (x-axis) of both groups. Within-group average change is also reported (unfilled, outlined bars). Activation change was calculated as activity post-NFB minus pre-NFB, wherein a positive change value represents an activity increase after receiving NFB. Error bars represent the 95 % confidence interval. X, y, z coordinates correspond to the Montreal Neurological Institute space. A, anterior; L, left; P, posterior; R, right.
